## Welcome to Fundbook

This is the content of my first blog post. In this post, I share my journey into building a blog with Next.js and Markdown files.

## About This Post

- **Next.js App Router:** Leveraging the new app directory structure.
- **Markdown Content:** All content is stored as Markdown files in the `/posts` directory.
- **Dynamic Slugs:** The slug is derived from the filename (e.g., `my-first-blog-post.md` becomes `my-first-blog-post`).

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoy reading this post. Stay tuned for more content as I continue exploring Next.js and Markdown integration.
